Important

I decided to not publish it in code, since it uses some methods to fetch data that would get blocked when published. If you have any concerns, feel free to contact me.
This tool is made for educational purposes only.
This tool is made by me in my free time, so please don't expect frequent updates.
You have to use proxies, without them the tool will not work. Either use your own proxies or you can write me, and I will provide you with some in exchange for a small donation to cover the costs.
