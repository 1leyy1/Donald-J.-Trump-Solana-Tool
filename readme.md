Important
</h1>
<p>
1. I decided, to not publish it in code, since it uses some methods to fetch data that would get blocked, when published. If you have any concerns, feel free to contact me.<br>
2. This tool is made for educational purposes only.<br>
3. This tool is made by me in my free time, so please dont expect frequent updates<br>
4. You have to use proxies, without them the tool will not work. Either use your own proxies or you can write me and I will provide you with some in exchange for a small donation to cover the costs.
